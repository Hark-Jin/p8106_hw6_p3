### Data Description  

In this assignment, we used dataset Instacart to complete analysis and draw inteactive charts. **Instacart** is an online grocery service that supports online-shopping from local stores. The dataset contains 1,384,617 observations of 131,209 unique users, where each row in the dataset is a product from an order. There is a single order per user in this dataset.

Below are 15 variables in this dataset:

*  order_id: order identifier  
*  product_id: product identifier  
*  add_to_cart_order: order in which each product was added to cart  
*  reordered: 1 if this prodcut has been ordered by this user in the past, 0 otherwise  
*  user_id: customer identifier  
*  eval_set: which evaluation set this order belongs in (Note that the data for use in this class is exclusively from the ???train??? eval_set)  
*  order_number: the order sequence number for this user (1=first, n=nth)  
*  order_dow: the day of the week on which the order was placed  
*  order_hour_of_day: the hour of the day on which the order was placed  
*  days_since_prior_order: days since the last order, capped at 30, NA if order_number=1  
*  product_name: name of the product  
*  aisle_id: aisle identifier  
*  department_id: department identifier  
*  aisle: the name of the aisle  
*  department: the name of the department

**Comments:**    
For problem 1  
  For the first graph, we showed the number of orders in different departments, which indicates that items from department produce are most frequently ordered.
  
  In the second graph, we changed the variable department to aisle, thus we can find out the the most popular kind of product in this dataset. And it shows that fruits and vegetables are the most popular products.
  
  Last graph we choosed the boxplot to show the distribution of order time for relatively popular aisles.  
  
  
  
### Problem 2

**Comments:**  
For problem 2   
  First, we made a graph showing the distribution of the most popular products in each department. Additionally, we added a slider filter to control the number of ordered items for different department.
   
  Secondly, we compared the number of orders for different aisles in each department. In produce department, fresh fruits and vegetables are most frequently ordered.
 
  Last, we wanted to plot the distribution of order time for each aisle, and we found that Healthier snacks are usually ordered earlier in the day.
